Last days, I have devoted to the v2 of ABTest system. And at the finish of the work, I realized my mistake.

1. I have cost too much time and energy on it.
2. Finnaly, the struct of code is complex. And hard to maintain.

I just want to make the web page beautiful and amazing. And don't think about other side of my work.

1. Is the beautiful of web page matter?
2. What's your goal?

One shouldn't loss his goal. Can't lost the target.
